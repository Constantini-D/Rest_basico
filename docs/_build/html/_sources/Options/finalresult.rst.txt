Final result of our project
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Running in the terminal the command `python manage.py runserserver` we will be able to run the program in the local server.

So we wil able to login in your superuser created in `'How to create a superuser' <installations.html#Sync-the-database-for-the-first-time>`_

And by accessing the url ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v2`` + ``/alunos/`` route and the name of your database  we will be able to use our REST application.
